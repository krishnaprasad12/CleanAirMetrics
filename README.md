# CleanAirMetrics - Tracking AQI with CPCB Standards

How is AQI calculated?
1. The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its 24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health breakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location.
2. All the eight pollutants may not be monitored at all the locations. Overall AQI is calculated only if data are available for minimum three pollutants out of which one should necessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Else, data are considered insufficient for calculating AQI. Similarly, a minimum of 16 hoursâ€™ data is considered necessary for calculating subindex.
3. The sub-indices for monitored pollutants are calculated and disseminated, even if data are inadequate for determining AQI. The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air quality status for that pollutant.
4. The web-based system is designed to provide AQI on real time basis. It is an automated system that captures data from continuous monitoring stations without human intervention, and displays AQI based on running average values (e.g. AQI at 6am on a day will incorporate data from 6am on previous day to the current day).
5. For manual monitoring stations, an AQI calculator is developed wherein data can be fed manually to get AQI value.
